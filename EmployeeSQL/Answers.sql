/* NOTE: This answer could be done in three different ways, using a subquery, using the WITH clause, or using a JOIN. 
The subquery is not the most efficient way as it would execute the subquery for every row on the main query. 
Therefore, the most efficient way to get the resultset is by using the WITH clause as it stores the resultset in a temporary table and reuses it as many times as needed, 
or with a JOIN clause.
